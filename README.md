# Odin Project - CSS Foundations Exercise A

Practice adding CSS to an HTML file using external CSS, internal CSS and inline CSS.

## UX

**User Stories**

1.  As a user, I should see a `div` element with a `red` background, `white` text, a font-size of `32px`, center-aligned and `bold`.

2.  As a user, I expect the CSS of the `div` element to be added externally by using a type selector.

3.  As a user, I should see the `p` element with a `green` background, `white` text, and a font-size of `18px`.

4.  The CSS of the `p` element should be added internally by using a type selector.

5.  As a user, I should see a `button` element with an `orange` background and font-size of `18px`.

6.  The CSS of the `button` element should have an inline style.
